**Automated Mockup Creation for Adobe Photoshop**

I created these scripts to automate my creation of shirt design mockups which, simplifying the tedious process of creating mockups. They're not perfect but they do the job well. :D

I need to create a fast way to get these mockups out so that I can use them in my Etsy shop ;)

These scripts are run in Photoshop. You may use them as you wish. 

**PART 1**
The application will automatically impose my designs into the shirt mockups of different colors and they each get exported as a single image.
This is achieved by running _generateShirtMockups.js_ from Photoshop.


**PART 2** 
Another script is run to resize and crop each of these image mockups, lay them all out into the canvas, created a grid of all available colors of my shirt mockups. This is achieved by running _generateAllShirtsDisplay.js_ from Photoshop.

Photoshop scripting is something I just encountered just a week ago. I find it quite a fun niche for me as a graphics design and web developer.

I will try to maintain these file, and hopefully create more scripts to automate some of my Photoshop tasks.
